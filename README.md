# About
**NBT Copy** is a small Minecraft mod adding copy button for the `/data get` command output.

It's a server-side mod, so to work with `/data get` on multiplayer it needs to be installed on the server, but it also works with [clientcommands](https://modrinth.com/mod/client-commands) `/cgetdata` on the client-side.
